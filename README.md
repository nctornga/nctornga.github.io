>I love you
But I don't really show you
I'd call you
But only if you want me too
Oh, don't you let it stop
Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
I will never stop
But only if you listen to me
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh
Oh, baby
Forgive me if I hurt you
Come save me
'Cause you're the only one for me
Oh, don't you let it stop
Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
I will never stop
But only if you listen to me
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh
Whatever happens to me, baby
I'm sorry
No one could ever go my way
I love you
But I don't really show you
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh
(Come inside of my heart, baby)
Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh

>San darating ang mga salita
Na nanggagaling sa aming dalawa
Kung lumisan ka wag naman sana
Ika'y kumapit na nang di makawala
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo
Mundo’y magiging ikaw
Wag mag-alala kung nahihirapan ka
Halika na sumama ka
Pagmasdan ang mga tala
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo
Mundo'y magiging ikaw
Limutin na ang mundo
Nang magkasama tayo
Sunod sa bawat galaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Di na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo(mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Aking sinta (limutin na ang mundo)
Ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (nang magkasama tayo mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik (sunod sa bawat galaw)
Mananatili na sa piling mo (hindi na maliligaw mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Limutin na ang mundo
Nang magkasama tayo
Sunod sa bawat galaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Mundo'y magiging ikaw

>Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're the one that I want to be with
Never want to be separated, oh
I'm captivated
Everyone says you're complicated
Every day, you're my most awaited, oh
I'm captivated
Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
Oh, I need you, and I really hate it
But I never get tired of waiting
I'm captivated
Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
